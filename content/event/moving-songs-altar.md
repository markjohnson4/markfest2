Want to enjoy feeling connected to the universe through a playlist of moving songs catered to me?!  Want to get a prize for accurately predicting what I'll like?!

Submit a Youtube link to a piece of music that you think will move me [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsnlk2qTD3rBajyQ7cZ8EnBleUG5ZAMHaEInVG4njgE6KrxA/viewform?usp=sf_link) sometime before the start of Mark Fest.  Then reach out to me to let me know you're participating in this event.

I'll then create a youtube playlist of all the links and share it with all participants on a special Discord channel.  We will check in with each other at the start of this event, leave to attentatively listen to all the songs (I will lie down on my bed in the dark), and then return for prizes.

Whoever submitted my favorite new-to-me music will win a $20 [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) gift card!  Whoever submitted my favorite old-to-me music will win a $5 iTunes gift card.
