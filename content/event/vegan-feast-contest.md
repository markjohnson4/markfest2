Want to encourage yourself to eat more vegan things without breaking the bank?!

Then join this contest!

Each participant will make a vegan feast for themselves using less than $20 of ingredients (excluding spices).  Plan your cooking so that you can comfortably jump in our Discord channel at 7pm and finish creating your feast by 8pm.  We'll then eat together!

I will declare winners in the following categories:

* Fanciest
* Greatest Quantity
* Most Inventive
* Most Likely to be Made by Me
