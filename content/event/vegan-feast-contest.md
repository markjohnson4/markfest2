Each participant will make a vegan feast for themselves using less than $20 of ingredients.

We'll all start cooking at the same time so we can enjoy hanging out while feast-prepping and learn some about each other's recipes.  Everyone will have one hour to make their feast*.

At the end I will grant winners in the following categories:

* Fanciest
* Greatest Quantity
* Most Inventive
* Most Likely to be Made by Me

\* Excluding essential prep like letting bread dough rise or beans soak, etc.
