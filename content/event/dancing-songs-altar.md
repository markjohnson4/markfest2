Want to enjoy dancing to a playlist catered to me?!  Want to get a prize for accurately predicting what I'll like?!

Submit a Youtube link to a song that you think I'll want to dance to [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFexzRSWjJOLtJc6iHUP2SNJw29E9GvhGRhA9x9RhdLE2elg/viewform) sometime before the start of Mark Fest.  Then reach out to me to let me know you're participating in this event.

I'll then create a youtube playlist of all the links and share the link to it with all participants on a special Discord channel.  We will check in with each other at the start of this event, leave to dance to the playlist, and then return for prizes.

Whoever submitted my favorite new-to-me song will win a $20 [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) gift card!  Whoever submitted my favorite old-to-me song will win a $5 iTunes gift card.
