Want to learn some new stuff related to healing the planet and talk about it with others?!

Then watch the documentary ["Super Fungi"](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Fungi-Anne-Rizzo/dp/B07117BQ6R) (52 minutes) with me and let's talk about it!

We'll start the documentary through Amazon's "watch together" option and then share our thoughts about it afterwards.
