Let's broadcast some charties that we love!

Each contest participant will have 1 minute to sell the group on a charity they love.  Then up to 4 minutes will be allowed for questions from the audience.  

After all the charities have been presented, members will then actually donate what they are moved to donate.  They will also log their donation amount and charity-choice via an online form.  The presenter of the charity that recieves the most money will be announced and win a prize for most persuasive charity expert.
