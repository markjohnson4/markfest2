Do you want to broadcast a charity you love, raise money for it, hear about some other charities, donate some money yourself, and feel great for donating money?!

Then participate in this contest!

Each participant will have 2 minute to sell the group on a charity they love.  Then up to 3 minutes will be allowed for questions from the audience.

After all the charities have been presented, members will then actually donate what they are moved to donate.  They will also log their donation amount and charity-choice via an online form.  The presenter of the charity that recieves the most money will win a $20 iTunes gift card for being the most persuasive charity expert!

I'm limiting this event to 8 people so that it doesn't take up too much time.  Reach out to me early to reserve your spot!
