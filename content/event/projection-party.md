Do you want to participate in a social experiment I invented?!

The setup is that I'll write down some stuff I did recently and then read it out loud to the group - but in a flat tone so that I don't reveal any of my attitudes about any detail.

In between statements, participants will be encouraged to respond in the format "that sounds ___" where the "___" is an an experience-word like "fun", "disgusting", "tedius", etc.  Participants are encouraged to collectively generate a variety of experience-words.  At the end, I'll award a $10 iTunes gift card for whoever I felt was the MVP of the experiment (participating with a fun energy).

## Why

I learned about the format "that sounds [feeling word]" in [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) training as a way to communicate:
1. You're empathizing with the speaker's experience
2. You're cool talking about [feeling word]
3. You're aware that you're a separate individual who may not understand their experience and are open to being wrong (via a tentafier like "that sounds...")

I like this format, not just for talking to someone in crisis, but for connecting with anyone talking about anything in their life (where I'm unsure what their attitude is about the thing they're talking about).  

In everyday life I sometimes project my own feelings and preferences onto others so I like that this type of statement gives the person I'm talking to an opportunity to correct me if I'm wrong.  And, as a bonus, I learn something about how we're different from each other so that I'm less likely to make the same projection-error with them in the future. And an extra bonus is that I might learn something about myself that I wrongly assumed was true for everybody else.

Projection-errors are invisible obstacles to connecting with others that we must first see before we can scale them.  I think they are a natural part of relationships so I want to celebrate this statement-format as a way to discover them.

In this experiment, I'm talking about life-details in a flat-voice in order to try to maximize projection-errors.  

I'm a little nervous about this activity being lame so please bring your fun energy and an open mind!
