I've been taking cold showers lately because they're exhilerating and it feels good to warm up afterwards.  Also [there's evidence](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-benefits) that they are healthy!

At the start of this event we'll get on discord to psych each other up, then we'll break for 15 minutes for a cold shower, then rejoin to warm up and congratulate each other!

## Tips

* Make an enjoyable warming-up plan like making coffee or hot chocolate.
* If you're not used to cold showers, try starting with warm water and then turning the water to cold at the end.
* Sing this to yourself: <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/941093035&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/alien-feet" title="Alien Feet" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Alien Feet</a> Â· <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alien-feet/get-psyched-up" title="Get psyched up for the shower" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Get psyched up for the shower</a></div>
