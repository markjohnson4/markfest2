I've been taking cold showers lately because they're exhilerating and it feels good to warm up afterwards.  Also [there's evidence](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-benefits) that they are healthy!

At the start of this event we'll get on discord to psych each other up, then we'll break for 15 minutes for a cold shower, then rejoin to warm up and congratulate each other!

## Tips

* Make an enjoyable warming-up plan like making coffee or hot chocolate.
* If you're not used to cold showers, try starting with warm water and then turning the water to cold at the end.
