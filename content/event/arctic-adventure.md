Want to experience social encouragement to experience cold water?!

Then come along on this artitic adventure!

I've been taking cold showers lately because they're exhilerating and it feels good to warm up afterwards.  Also [there's evidence](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-benefits) that they are healthy!

At the start of this event we'll get on discord to psych each other up, then we'll break for 15 minutes for a cold shower, then rejoin to warm up and congratulate each other!

## Tips

* Make an enjoyable warming-up plan like making coffee or hot chocolate.
* If you're not used to cold showers, try starting with warm water and then turning the water to cold at the end.
* Take deep breaths and pretend that you don't mind the cold
