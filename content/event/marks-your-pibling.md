This event is for all the chiblings (children of siblings) in my life, their parents, and their piblings (siblings of parents).  

We'll play "Loaded Questions", which is a fun game for learning about others.  In each round, a hypothetical question is posed to the group like "If you could talk with a type of animal, what would it be?", everyone submits their answer in an online form, and then one person in the group guesses who wrote what and gets points for correct answers.  Each person will get a chance to be the guesser.

I'm limiting this event to 10 people so the game doesn't get too crazy.  Reach out to me to reserve your spot!
