A discord channel for brainstorming ideas for your *own* festival!

I have a previous "Mark Fest" under my belt so I can help give tips, such as:

1. Consider the minimum number of people you need to feel like your event is a success and seek out that number to commit to being "co-sponsors" (gaurenteed atendees).
2. Make the event easy enough to pull off so that you'll actually do it

I created "Mark Fest" because I wanted to share a variety of unique activities with the anyone in my life who is also drawn to those activites.  It's a part of my life-journey of better advertising myself. I hope it encourages the people in my life to also advertise themselves more so I have more ways to connect with them.
